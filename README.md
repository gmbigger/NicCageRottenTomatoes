# NicCageRottenTomatoes
A small project that uses python to web scrape Rotten Tomatoes to get information on movies staring Nicolas Cage

I used python to scrape title, score and box office data from Rotten Tomatoes on all Nicolas Cage films

I've included both a .py file and a notebook.

I've included both a .csv and .xlsx file for upload to a SQL client

I used MySQL Workbench but included files for both MySQL and SQL Server.

The SQL files contain several different queries that I thought were of interest but only the query filtering out NULL values was used to create a new 'clean' .csv file.

The 'clean' file can be uploaded to Tableau or Power BI though NULL values can be filtered out in those applications as well.

I created a few visualizations in Tableau Public and they are available to view through the following link.
